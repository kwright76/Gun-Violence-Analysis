# Gun-Violence-Analysis
## This project is for the Dashboards and Visualizations MSIS course at Santa Clara University. We are using the below data as our data source and the project will consist of three phases. Firstly, an exploratory phase where we compiled, cleansed, and explained the data in detail. Next, the first version of visualizations based on non-trivial findings using Altair. Lastly, the Revised version will give a final visualization of our data findings that will be reproducible and self contained.
