### Topic: Gun Violence in the United States
This project aims to develop a data product that makes complex data-driven argument by utilizing several visualizations. The data product will have to be repeatable, inspectable, reusable, and diffable, hence, the project will be well documented in jupyter notebook. This [article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) by Vox on America's unique gun violence problem explained in various charts, served as the initial inspiration of the project. This was our data [source](https://www.kaggle.com/gunviolencearchive/gun-violence-database#officer_involved_shootings.csv
) that we used throughout project.

The project consist of the following three parts:
1. **Explorotary Data Analysis:** 
The data is compiled, cleansed, and explained the in detail.
2. **First Version:**
Visualizations are formed based on non-trivial findings using Altair and Tableau.
3. **Revised Version:**
