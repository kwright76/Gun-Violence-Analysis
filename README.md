### Topic: Gun Violence in the United States
This project aims to develop a data product that makes complex data-driven argument by utilizing several visualizations. The data product will have to be repeatable, inspectable, reusable, and diffable, hence, the project will be well documented in jupyter notebook. This [article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) by Vox on America's unique gun violence problem explained in various charts, served as the initial inspiration of the project. This was our data [source](https://www.kaggle.com/gunviolencearchive/gun-violence-database#officer_involved_shootings.csv
) that we used throughout project.

The project consist of the following three parts:
1. **Explorotary Data Analysis:** 
The data is compiled, cleansed, and explained the in detail.
2. **First Version:**
Visualizations are formed based on non-trivial findings using Altair and Tableau.
3. **Revised Version:** 
The final visualization of our data findings that will be reproducible and self contained.

## First Version
5/26/2019  
Added visualizations created via Tableau and Altair to show further analysis on the dataset on:  
  
**Claim 1**: Intentional gun violence leads to more deaths while accidental incidents result in a smaller number of deaths.
  
**Claim 2**: Gun violence incidents tend to rise when the weather is warmer or during the holiday seasons.
  
**Claim 3**: States with the highest number of gun crimes does not necessarily have the largest average number of deaths or injuries occurring from the incidents.
