### Topic: Gun Violence in the United States
This project aims to develop a data product that makes complex data-driven argument by utilizing several visualizations. The data product will have to be repeatable, inspectable, reusable, and diffable, hence, the project will be well documented in jupyter notebook. This [article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) by Vox on America's unique gun violence problem explained in various charts, served as the initial inspiration of the project. This was our data [source](https://www.kaggle.com/gunviolencearchive/gun-violence-database#officer_involved_shootings.csv
) that we used throughout project.

The project consist of the following three parts:
1. **Explorotary Data Analysis:** 
The data is compiled, cleansed, and explained the in detail.
2. **First Version:**
Visualizations are formed based on non-trivial findings using Altair and Tableau.
3. **Revised Version:** 
The final visualization of our data findings that will be reproducible and self contained.

This project has led to several insights about the unique Gun Violence problem in the U.S. Click [here](https://github.com/kwright76/Gun-Violence-Analysis/blob/master/Revised%20Version.ipynb) to check out our final product and findings!
