# Gun-Violence-Analysis
## This project is for the Dashboards and Visualizations MSIS course at Santa Clara University. We are using the below data as our data source and the project will consist of three phases. Firstly, an exploratory phase where we compiled, cleansed, and explained the data in detail. Next, the first version of visualizations based on non-trivial findings using Altair. Lastly, the Revised version will give a final visualization of our data findings that will be reproducible and self contained.

## First Version
5/26/2019  
Added visualizations created via Tableau and Altair to show further analysis on the dataset on:  
  
**Claim 1**: Intentional gun violence leads to more deaths while accidental incidents result in a smaller number of deaths.
  
**Claim 2**: Gun violence incidents tend to rise when the weather is warmer or during the holiday seasons.
  
**Claim 3**: States with the highest number of gun crimes does not necessarily have the largest average number of deaths or injuries occurring from the incidents.
