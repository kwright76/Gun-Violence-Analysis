This project aims to develop a data product that makes complex data-driven argument by utilizing several visualizations. The data product will have to be repeatable, inspectable, reusable, and diffable, hence, the project will be well documented in the jupyter notebook. This [article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) served as the initial inspiration of the project, and this was our data [source](https://www.kaggle.com/gunviolencearchive/gun-violence-database#officer_involved_shootings.csv
) that we used for the project.

The project consist of the following three parts:
1. **Explorotary Data Analysis:** compiled, cleansed, and explained the data in detail
2. **First Version:** based on non-trivial findings using Altair
3. **Revised Version:** final visualization of our data findings that will be reproducible and self contained.
