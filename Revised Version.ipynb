    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Gun violence has been a hot topic of society throughout history. In recent times events of gun injuries or deaths have specifically been driven towards children and teenagers. News reports involving gun violence have increased dramatically in recent years, causing safety concerns for children and teens in the U.S.. Thus, making prevention paramount. Katie Gagnon wrote in a Philly Voice article that <i>every day, 78 kids or teens are killed or injured by gun violence. This is unacceptable but it can be changed (Gagnon, K., 2019)</i>. Accidental and intentional acts of violence make up a large split blaming gun owners for being careless.\n",
    "  \n",
    "From our background reading on the topic of gun violence in the U.S., we found that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Firearms are the second leading cause of death for children and teens (CDC, 2017).\n",
    "- Compared to other high-income countries, American children aged 5 to 14 are 21 times more likely to be killed with guns, and American adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 are 23 times more likely to be killed with guns (Everytown for Gun Safety, 2019).\n",
    "- When American children and teens are killed with guns, 58 percent are homicides, with 85% of those deaths occuring in the home, and nearly a third of those deaths are connected to intimate partner or family violence (Everytown for Gun Safety, 2019).\n",
    "- There have been at least 405 incidents of gunfire on school grounds from 2013 to 2018. Of these, 260 occurred on the grounds of an elementary, middle, or high school, resulting in 109 deaths and 219 injuries (Everytown for Gun Safety, 2019).\n",
    "- Hunting season takes place between July - Dec"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "While some may argue that a change in legislature to tighten gun laws is the way to go, its impact is not profound as people with an intention to procure a gun, especially with an intention to do harm, do not go through the system to purchase guns legally. They find other means to obtain their guns, often illegally. Therefore, more effort needs to be put in place, such as programs like Be SMART, to creating gun violence prevention and safety amongst gun owners in hopes to reduce gun violence incidents involving children and teens, especially in unintentional incidents that could have been prevented with precaution measures."
